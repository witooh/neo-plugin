# neo-dev-toolkit

Opinionated Claude Code plugin that bundles seven composable skills for end-to-end software development — from idea to merged MR.

## What's inside

| Skill | Purpose | Triggers on |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **`neo`** | Route a software-development task to specialist agents (BA, Architect, Developer, QA, Code Reviewer, Security, System Analyzer) via phase-based analysis. No fixed workflow — supports single-role calls (สร้าง AC, gen test cases, review PR, fix bug) and multi-role tasks (เพิ่ม endpoint, refactor). Auto Dev loop (Dev → QA → Code Reviewer). Single entry point for GitLab MR **create** and **review** (with a JIRA card → AC/TC compliance; without → code + security + regression), calling the `gitlab` skill for glab I/O. For JIRA-card work, persists a resumable task-file (`docs/tasks/<card-id>/plan.md`) + enforces plan+task before coding. | Any dev task that touches AC, design, code, tests, API, or security; "สร้าง MR", "review MR"; "continue ABC-123" to resume a tracked card; or explicit `/neo` |
| **`brainstorm`** | Turn vague requests into actionable outputs via adaptive guided questioning. Prompt / Explore / Focused modes. | "brainstorm", "ช่วยคิด", "I have an idea", "let's explore" |
| **`improve`** | Iteratively refine any output (code, prose, data, config) until a measurable finish-line condition holds — autonomous improve → self-evaluate loop modeled on `/goal`. | "improve this", "make it better", "ปรับปรุง", "iterate" |
| **`api-doc`** | Two commands, each with a two-layer verify. **gen**: scan Go handler/router/usecase source → a runnable Bruno OpenCollection workspace (with embedded `docs:`), or validate it against the code. **publish**: sync that collection to Confluence pages via `acli` + REST. | "gen api doc", "สร้าง api doc", "gen open collection", "api doc outdated" → gen; "sync api doc", "push doc to confluence" → publish |
| **`gitlab`** | Low-level GitLab `glab` execution arm — neo invokes it for MR create + review-comment posting; also usable directly for read/summarize, update description, list MRs, CI status/logs, approve. (Create / review / fix / feedback now route through `neo`.) | Bare MR URL, "อ่าน MR", "อัพเดท MR", "list MRs", "check pipeline" |
| **`commit`** | Smart git commit workflow — protected-branch guard, auto `feature/*` branching, rebase onto base, secret-aware staging, conventional commit messages, optional push. | "commit", "/commit", "commit and push", "ช่วย commit", "เสร็จแล้ว" |
| **`atlassian`** | Drive Jira + Confluence from the terminal via the `acli` CLI — view/search/create/edit/transition/assign work items, manage sprints/boards/projects, read pages + manage spaces. A thin shell over `acli --help` that carries the command map + JQL/workflow/safety judgment; also the acli reference `neo` points to. (Verifying a JIRA card in a dev workflow → `neo`; publishing API docs to Confluence → `api-doc`.) | "ดู issue ของฉัน", "view my issues", "transition ไป In Progress", "search ด้วย JQL", "ดู Confluence page", any raw acli op |

## Companion pieces

- `/neo <task>` — invokes the `neo` orchestrator skill directly
- `SessionStart` hook — injects a short reminder on `startup | clear | compact` so Claude proactively picks the right skill

## Installation

Install the plugin straight from this GitHub repo — no local clone needed:

```bash
# From inside Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add witooh/neo-plugin
/plugin install neo-dev-toolkit@neo
```

`witooh/neo-plugin` is the GitHub `owner/repo` shorthand. Claude Code reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from the default branch and resolves the plugin from there.

If the repo is private or you prefer an explicit URL:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/witooh/neo-plugin.git
/plugin install neo-dev-toolkit@neo
```

### Updating

```bash
# 1. Pull the latest marketplace listing from GitHub
/plugin marketplace update neo

# 2. Reinstall so the new plugin version is loaded
/plugin uninstall neo-dev-toolkit@neo
/plugin install neo-dev-toolkit@neo
```

Open a fresh Claude Code session to confirm the updated skills are active.

## Usage

Three ways to kick off work:

1. **Automatic** — the SessionStart hook tells Claude which skill to reach for; just describe the task naturally
2. **Slash command** — `/neo <task description>` runs the full orchestrator
3. **Direct ask** — "ช่วย review MR นี้...", "gen api doc ให้หน่อย", "brainstorm วิธีออกแบบ..."
